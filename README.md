 Overview
==========================================================================================================================

This README.md file documents the submission for the course project for Getting and Cleaning data.

The course project is based on the data and information available at the following URLs:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

This implementation of the project relies solely on a straight-forward reading of the course project instructions.

Because there is not any vernacular explanation of the variables, we avoid the risk of misconstrual and do not 
fabricate column names beyond the language provided in the features.txt file and readme file, except where we
are required to derive means, in which case we prepend "Mean" to the affected column names.


 Data 
==========================================================================================================================

All data is found in the .zip file at the second URL, above, and all data files from all folders of the .zip files
must be in the working directory in which run_analysis.R is run.

Inventory of data required and how it is used:


        Data Shared by Test and Train
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 

Memory Variable         Source File             Data Description

activity_labels         activity_labels.txt     Names of activities, to be looked up based on activity numbers in the y_test.txt file

col_names_561           features.txt            Feature names related to the columns of the x_test data
                                                This file lists feature names down its first column, and these names 
                                                must be used horizontally across the x_test.txt and x_train.txt data, 
                                                below, as column names.

 Process
==========================================================================================================================

All work is accomplished by run_analysis.R, and consists of the following steps of the course project Instruction:

1.Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.  (My step 1)

2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. (My step 4)

3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set (My step 2 and throughout)

4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. (My step 3 and throughout)

5.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
  (My step 5)

        1. Merge Process (Instruction step 1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The data shared by both test and train data is read into memory variables inventoried above. This includes activity names 
and columns for the feature data (x_test/train).

2. The test data is read into memory variables.

3. The test data is merged into a row structure that includes a test/train identifier column, activity number column, activity 
name column, subject number column, feature columns, and columns for all measurement vectors.  

Here's the vignette of code that accomplishes step 3 of the merge process:

        ```{r}
        test_data <- cbind(Test_or_Train_Test,
                           activities_with_names_test, 
                           subjects_test, 
                           feature_data_test, 
                           body_acc_x_test,
                           body_acc_y_test,
                           body_acc_z_test,
                           body_gyro_x_test,
                           body_gyro_y_test,
                           body_gyro_z_test,
                           total_acc_x_test,
                           total_acc_y_test,
                           total_acc_z_test)
        ```

4. The train data is read into memory variables.

5. The train data is merged into a row structure that includes a test/train identifier column, activity number column, activity 
name column, subject number column, feature columns, and columns for all measurement vectors.  This merge process uses code that 
is similar to the code shown above, for test data.

6. After consolidating the test data into a single data frame using cbind and, separately, consolidating the train data into a another single data frame using cbind, we consolidate the test data with the train data using rbind. This is quite straightforward:

```{r}
semi_semi_tidy_data_set <- rbind(test_data, train_data)
```

7. Observation numbers are inferred by serializing the rows and cbinded as the first column.

```{r}
Observation_Number <- data.frame(Observation_Number = 1:nrow(semi_semi_tidy_data_set))

semi_tidy_data_set      <- cbind(Observation_Number, semi_semi_tidy_data_set)
```

8. Results: The columns across the resulting data structure are as follows:

Column Name                             Column Number           Source

Observation number                      1                       Serial by row
"Test" or "Train" Indicator             2                       Hard coded based on data source
Activity Number                         3                       y_test/train
Activity Name                           4                       activity_labels assigned based on Activity Number
Subject Number                          5                       subjects_test/train
561 feature columns                     6 - 566                 x_test/train
Body Acceleration x-Axis                567 - 694               body_acc_x_test/train
Body Acceleration y-Axis                695 - 822               body_acc_y_test/train
Body Acceleration z-Axis                823 - 950               body_acc_z_test/train
Body Gyroscopic x-Axis                  951 - 1078              body_gyro_x_test/train
Body Gyroscopic y-Axis                  1079 - 1206             body_gyro_y_test/train
Body Gyroscopic z-Axis                  1207 - 1334             body_gyro_z_test/train
Total Acceleration x-Axis               1335 - 1462             total_acc_x_test/train
Total Acceleration y-Axis               1463 - 1590             total_acc_y_test/train
Total Acceleration z-Axis               1591 - 1718             total_acc_z_test/train

The row counts are as follows:

Data Type                               Row Count

Test                                     2,947
Train                                    7,352

Total Row Count                         10,299

Total dimensions of the intial merge of the data in the .zip file is 10,299 rows and 1,718 columns.

        2.  How we assigned descriptive activity names (Instruction step 3)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Activity numbers are used to associate activity names, and to name these columns along the way:

```{r}
colnames(activity_labels)     <- c("Activity_Number", "Activity_Name")
colnames(activities_test)     <- "Activity_Number"
activities_with_names_test    <- data.frame(Activity_Number = activities_test$Activity_Number,
                                            Activity_Name   = activity_labels[activities_test$Activity_Number,2])
```

        3. Where and how we inferred descriptive variable names (Instruction step 4)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For feature data column names we use features.txt, as these are as descriptive as possible/necessary given the available 
information. 

For column names for the windowed measurement data vectors we infer some vernacular names based on the file names, thus:

```{r}
body_acc_x_col_names <- ""
for (i in 1:ncol(body_acc_x_test)) {
        body_acc_x_col_names[i] <- paste("Undefined_Body_Acceleration_x_Variable_", i, sep = "")
```

In this way, for columns in body_acc_x_test we thus form the column names "Undefined_Body_Acceleration_x_Variable_1" 
through "Undefined_Body_Acceleration_x_Variable_128", and likewise for all the body_ and total_ windowed measurement data files.

        4. How we did the extract of "only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement".  
           (Instruction step 2)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To select columns for the extract we built a vector, extracts, to use as a select argument with the subset() function, by iterating across the 
column names of the merged data frame, semi_tidy_data_set, using regular expressions to look for "mean" or "std" in the column name. Where 
we found "mean" or "std" in the column name, the column name was appended to the extracts vector. 

We then subsetted the merged data set using this vector as the select argument to produce the first tidy data set.

```{r}
extracts <- names(semi_tidy_data_set)[1:5]
extracts_index <- 5
for (i in 1:ncol(semi_tidy_data_set)){
               
        if (regexpr("std", names(semi_tidy_data_set)[i]) > 0){
                extracts_index <- extracts_index + 1
                extracts[extracts_index] <- names(semi_tidy_data_set[i])
        }
        
        if (regexpr("mean", names(semi_tidy_data_set)[i]) > 0){
                extracts_index <- extracts_index + 1
                extracts[extracts_index] <- names(semi_tidy_data_set[i])
        }    
}

first_tidy_data_set <- subset(semi_tidy_data_set, select=extracts)

        5. How we created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity 
           and each subject.  (Instruction step 5)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interpretation: Our approach to this takes the domain of data as all-inclusive, as there is no restriction in the instruction.
Our approach also makes the inferrence that the instruction intends to convey that we strike the mean of each variable 
for every unique combination of activity and subject, as the alternative data structure of combining domain-wide means
for each activity with separate domain-wide means for each subject into one data set would appear to lack any rational purpose.

1. Aggregate() -- We use the aggregate() function to strike the means based on the grouping criteria in our interpretation, 
passing activty number and subject to the by argument in a list.

This vignette of code gives us the basic data structure and the arithmetic means. Note that, to include the appropriate 
domain of data, we use the final merged data frame (semi_tidy_data_set), and not the extract data frame (first_tidy_data_set) 
from our Step 4/Instruction step 2, as the extract data frame does not include all variables and the merge data frame does.

```{r}
semi_second_independent_tidy_data_set <- aggregate(x = semi_tidy_data_set[, 6:ncol(semi_tidy_data_set)], 
                                                   by = list(semi_tidy_data_set$Activity_Number, semi_tidy_data_set$Subject), 
                                                   FUN = "mean", 
                                                   na.rm = T)

```

2.  In the course of this, the aggregate function affects column names, and we had to redress this for the final version.

Here we restore column names lost in the aggregate() call and produce the second_independent_tidy_data_set.

```{r}
# Fix up column names resulting from aggregation

colnames(semi_second_independent_tidy_data_set)[1] <- "Activity_Number"

colnames(semi_second_independent_tidy_data_set)[2] <- "Subject"

3.  Because we aggregated the data on activity numbers and for simplicity did not carry forward the activity names, here we reapply 
the activity names using the list of activity numbers in the aggregated structure, producing the second_independent_tidy_data_set.

second_activity_names <- data.frame(Activity_Number = semi_second_independent_tidy_data_set$Activity_Number,
                                    Activity_Name   = activity_labels[semi_second_independent_tidy_data_set$Activity_Number,2])

second_independent_tidy_data_set <- cbind(second_activity_names,
                                          semi_second_independent_tidy_data_set[ , 2:ncol(semi_second_independent_tidy_data_set)])

```

4. In line with course project Instruction step 4 to use descriptive variable names, here we revise the 
column names in the second_independent_tidy_data_set for descriptive accuracy by adding the word "Mean" 
to the beginning of the variable columns. 

Again, we do this by iterating across the column names for the averaged variables in columns 4 and following,
prepending "Mean" to each column name, and appending each new column name to a vector we'll use with
colnames(second_independent_tidy_data_set) to rename the columns.

```{r}
# Revise column names for each variable to reflect that these are now means of the original variables

mean_names <- ""
mean_names_index = 0
for (colname in names(second_independent_tidy_data_set)[4:ncol(second_independent_tidy_data_set)]){
        mean_names_index <- mean_names_index + 1
        mean_names[mean_names_index] <- (paste("Mean_" , colname, sep = ""))
}

colnames(second_independent_tidy_data_set)[4:ncol(second_independent_tidy_data_set)] <- mean_names

```

4. Creating the data set on disc.

This was straighforward. Note that, because there were commas in the column names provided in the .zip file,
we used the semicolon ";" as a separator so we could parse the file into Excel and manually verify our averages.

```{r}

write.table(second_independent_tidy_data_set, 
            file = "c:/workspace/second_independent_tidy_data_set.txt", 
            append = FALSE, 
            quote = TRUE, 
            sep = ";",
            eol = "\n", 
            na = "NA", 
            dec = ".", 
            row.names = FALSE,
            col.names = TRUE, 
            qmethod = c("escape", "double"))

```
