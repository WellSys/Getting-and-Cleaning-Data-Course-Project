Data Set Information:

Experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

Attribute Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Measurement Data Summary
========================

 The following summarizes how the measurement data were obtained.  

 The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 

 The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data, resulting in nine unique subjects for the test data, and 21 unique subjects for the train data.

 The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. 

 This approach results in one data file each for accelerometer and gyroscope data for each of three axes, labeled, x, y, and z, for a total of six measurement data files.  Additionally, the provider summarized accelration totals for each of the three access, resulting in nine total files for test and nine total files for train, each of which contains 128 variables of unspecified information.  

Analysis Data Summary
=====================

 Our deliverable data set is predicated on the following data structure.

 From each window created in the measurement process above, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

 The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz.   Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

 Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

 Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

 These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern: '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

         tBodyAcc-XYZ
         tGravityAcc-XYZ
         tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
         tBodyGyro-XYZ
         tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
         tBodyAccMag
         tGravityAccMag
         tBodyAccJerkMag
         tBodyGyroMag
         tBodyGyroJerkMag
         fBodyAcc-XYZ
         fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
         fBodyGyro-XYZ
         fBodyAccMag
         fBodyAccJerkMag
         fBodyGyroMag
         fBodyGyroJerkMag 

 The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

         mean(): Mean value
         std(): Standard deviation
         mad(): Median absolute deviation 
         max(): Largest value in array
         min(): Smallest value in array
         sma(): Signal magnitude area
         energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
         iqr(): Interquartile range 
         entropy(): Signal entropy
         arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
         correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
         maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
         meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
         skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
         kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
         bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
         angle(): Angle between to vectors.

 Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

         gravityMean
         tBodyAccMean
         tBodyAccJerkMean
         tBodyGyroMean
         tBodyGyroJerkMean

Summary of Data Merge
=====================

Our deliverable requires us to consolidate the data provided into one data set.  We do this by re-combining the data along its normal dimensions, outlined above, so that we have named activities and commensurable variable names across test and train, and so we can associate measurement data with analsyis data in the same observation, or row, of the merged data set. 

Our resulting merged data set, semi_tidy_data_set, has these characteristics:

        Total dimensions of the intial merge of the data in the .zip file is 10,299 rows and 1,718 columns.
                
 This data structure is in semi_tidy_data_set in run_analsyis.R, and run_analysis.R writes semi_tidy_data_set.txt to disc.
        
Summary of Extract
==================

For the creation of our extract of columns containing means and standard deviations, we relied on the information in Analysis Data Summary, above, and subsetted the merged data set by selecting those measurement and analysis data columns that contained the string 'mean' or the string 'std'.

This resulted in an extract data set, first_tidy_data_set, having the following characteristics.

Summary of Deliverable
======================

 Our approach to this takes the domain of data as all-inclusive, as there is no restriction in the instruction. Therefore,
 for the deliverable, second_independent_tidy_data_set, we began with the data in the merge data set.
 
 Our approach also makes the inferrence that the instruction intends to convey that we strike the mean of each variable 
 for every unique combination of activity and subject, as the alternative data structure of combining domain-wide means
 for each activity with separate domain-wide means for each subject into one data set would appear to lack any rational purpose.

 Aggregate() -- We use the aggregate() function to strike the means based on the grouping criteria in our interpretation, 
 passing activty number and subject to the by argument in a list.
 
 Lastly, rename the columns to reflect that the values are mean averages.

        The row counts are as follows: 30 subjects and six actvities produce rows for 180 unique combinations
        of activities and subjects.
        
        The total dimensions of the second independent tidy data set of mean variables by activity and subject
        are 180 rows and 1,716 columns.
